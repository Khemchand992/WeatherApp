## Technologies Used

### 1. **ReactJS**
React is at the core of this project, handling the app’s interactive UI and data management. React’s component-based architecture ensures that the application is scalable and maintainable.

### 2. **Context API**
We’re using Context API to manage the state of the app globally, making data like weather conditions and user settings accessible across components without the need for prop drilling.

### 3. **OpenWeather API**
WeatherApp relies on the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data for different cities. If you're interested, you can get an API key by signing up [here](https://openweathermap.org/api).

### 4. **CSS3**
For styling, we used **CSS3** to make the app visually appealing and fully responsive. The design ensures that it adapts beautifully across various screen sizes, whether on mobile or desktop.
